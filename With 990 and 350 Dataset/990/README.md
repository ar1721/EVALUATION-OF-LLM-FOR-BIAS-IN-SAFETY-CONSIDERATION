# 990 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations #

This dataset is part of the DICES consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 990 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 173 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with three safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited so that the number of raters for each conversation was balanced by gender (man, woman) and locale (US, India). Each rater rated only a sample of the dataset. Each conversation has been rated by 60-70 unique raters. The total rows in this dataset are: 72103.

**NB:** the results presented in the papers typically deal with 160 unique raters in the rater pool (after applying our rater quality criteria). However, in the released data we provide all ratings from all 172 raters in case other researchers want to apply a different strategy for quality of raters.

Each row of the dataset represents the collection of ratings by one rater on one conversation, or in other words, all ratings for a (rater, conversation) pair. The field **rater_id** indicates the rater and the field **item_id** indicates the conversation (see description of all fields below). 
Here are a few useful python recipes for viewing the data. 

Load the data into pandas.
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_990.csv")
```

View all ratings associated with one conversation.
```
df[df.item_id == 193]
```

List all unique conversations.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="item_id")
```

List all unique raters.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="rater_id")
```

## Overview of annotation fields ##
- **Field 1** is an id unique to each (rater, conversation) pair
- **Fields 2-9** provide metadata about raters
- **Fields 10-12 provide metadata about conversations 
- **Fields 13-14** contain the expert annotations for harm type and degree of harm
- **Fields 15-39** contain all the granular safety ratings from individual raters 
- **Fields 40-43** contain aggregated safety ratings from all the ratings from all raters per conversation
